                     intercourse. Conventional esthetic vaginal surgery has the potential to cause damage to blood
                     vessels and nerves, However, the EV Filler treatment is excellent for maintaining the sexuality of
                     women because there is no such risks.</li>

               <p>The last but certainly not least are the QT Fillers. QT Fillers are 100% Biodegradable. These series
                  of fillers are extremely hydrating and are hydrophilic. Allowing the filler to absorb and lock in
                  moisture as well as water to give you a voluminous filler. Their fillers have a broad range of
                  duration from low up to the long-lasting ones. Another great thing about QT Plus fillers is that their
                  fillers are made with High-Density Tapping Process h-DTP. What this means is that QT Plus fillers have
                  a high viscosity, allowing it to give you an excellent volume and retain its shape. What's more, is
                  that QT Fillers are easily moldable and can last for a long period of time.

                     structure gives the gel a stable consistent. It has a low content of product migration, which means
                     that once injected, the filler is more likely to stay close to the injection site and result in a
                     more accurate result.</p>
                  <p>The consistency allows for natural volume, smooth injection and promotes a stronger support system
                     within the skin structure. The product is designed in order to appear natural until it over time is

               <p>BOTULAX is a peripheral muscle relaxant that contains purified botulinum toxin type A (in combination
                  with hemagglutinin) and sodium chloride (excipient). The mechanism of action of the product is based
                  on
                  the ability of botulinum toxin type A to block the transmission of nerve impulses. Intramuscular
                  administration of the toxin disrupts the synthesis of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter that provides
                  neuromuscular conduction) and leads to temporary paralysis of facial muscles. Reduced facial
                  expression
                  helps to relax the face and smooth wrinkles.
                  The advantages of Botulax are that Botulax is strictly controlled for safety and high stable potency,
                  has
                  a purity of 99% and safety & efficacy have been successfully proved compared with Botox. Botulax

               </p>

               <h5>DOSAGES:</h5>
               <p>For blepharospasm the initial recommended dose is 1.25 – 2.5 U (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site)
                  injected into the medial and lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the
                  lateral
                  pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. For pediatric cerebral palsy, a total dose of 4U/kg
                  bodyweight is recommended for the affected gastrocnemius muscle in patients with hemiplegia. And in
                  patients with diplegia, the recommended dose is 6U/kg bodyweight divided between both legs. The
                  maximum
                  dose administered must not exceed 200U/patient at a time. For Glabellar wrinkles reconstituted sterile
                  saline. 20U is used and there are additional application instructions for best practice, actual

               <p>In Blepharospasm, the effects should appear within three days and peak after three weeks. For
                  pediatric
                  cerebral palsy applications, the expectation is improvement within four weeks of the injection. The
                  effects vary for glabellar wrinkles due to the usually individualized dosages.
               </p>
               <h5>PRECAUTIONS:</h5>
               <p>There is the possibility of reactions at the site of an injection, and effects beyond the injection
                  site,
                  including but not limited to asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia,
                  dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. Serious hypersensitivity has
                  been
                  reported as rare. There is a caution for people with pre-existing neuromuscular disorders, and for
                  those
                  with corneal exposure and ulceration in blepharospasm. Botulium Toxin Type A is not to be administered
                  at
                  all if a patient has a known allergy to any of the ingredients, or if the patients have neuromuscular
                  junctional disorders or known to have adverse reactions. They should not be administered while taking
                  muscle relaxants and some antibiotics. Further, the actual effects of prolonged use are not entirely
                  explored. There is also additional advice for the specific therapeutic conditions mentioned, as this
                  description is not comprehensive.</p>
               <h5>IN THE CASE OF OVERDOSE:</h5>
               <p>In the case of an overdose it has been advised that effects may not be immediate. It is further
                  advised
                  that the patient be monitored for muscle weakness and/or paralysis for a period of weeks after the
                  occurrence. There is an anti-toxin available but the caution with the anti-toxin is that it will not
                  reduce any already apparent effects.</p>
